## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The focus on this particular challenge was to keep the HTML and CSS code to a minimum i.e. not using 'divs' or 'styles' which were
unnecessary to complete the challenge.


### Continued development

Future development will focus on Flexbox, Grid and again keeping only the necessary amout of HTML and CSS and also improve my position
knowledge.
